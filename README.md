# Pre Eoc Xp Drops

Creates the 2010-2011 xp counter, and xp drops, either 2010-style, or 2012 style, while adding some more customisability to them.

Current Features:

- Drag and Drop location of the counter, and along with it, the 2010-style xp drop.
- 2012-style xp drops, that stay fixed center, regardless of where you place the counter
- Set xp drop font size
- Set the cutoff for "lots!" on the xp counter
- Choose which skill to track on the counter, hovering reveals the selected skill (if tooltips are enabled)
- The counter resizes based on the xp displayed. The size is (almost) identical to what would have been displayed in 2011.
- Now with an option to display only the xp drops, or only the counter
- Fake Xp Drops

Default settings are next-to-identical to 2010, except the ugly ribbon drop isn't included. 2012 xp drops are also next-to identical
to what they looked like at the time. Now with Fake Xp drops as well! (Turn XP drops in-game on and enable fake xp drops. Graphics are overriden)
