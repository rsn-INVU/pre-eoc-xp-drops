# Pre Eoc Xp Drops

Creates the 2010-2011 xp counter, and xp drops, while adding some more customisability to them.

Current Features:

- Drag and Drop location
- Set xp drop font size
- Set the cutoff for "lots!" on the xp counter
- Choose which skill to track on the counter, hovering reveals the selected skill (if tooltips are enabled)
- The counter resizes based on the xp displayed. The size is (almost) identical to what would have been displayed in 2011.

Default settings are next-to-identical to 2010, except the ugly ribbon drop isn't included.
